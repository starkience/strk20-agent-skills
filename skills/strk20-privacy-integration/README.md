# strk20-privacy-integration

An ask-and-plan agent skill (Claude Code / Codex-compatible) that kick-starts an STRK20 privacy integration for Starknet projects.

Drop it into the agent running in your project repo and ask it to "plan STRK20 privacy for this app." The skill:

1. **Scans your repo** — detects your Starknet stack (starknet.js, get-starknet, starknet-react, Scarb/Cairo contracts, Starknet Foundry, backend SDKs) and finds the plug-in points.
2. **Interviews you** — a short, adaptive set of questions (builder type, what exactly should be private, environment) instead of a generic questionnaire.
3. **Picks your route** — Privacy Wallet API via starknet.js (most dapps, buildable now), anonymizer contract + Wallet API (DeFi protocols, reference examples public), Privacy SDK direct (wallets/backends with their own keys, buildable now — the [SDK monorepo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy) is open source), or private sub-accounts (coming soon).
4. **Writes `STRK20_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`** — phased, versioned, honest about what's hidden vs visible, naming your actual files.

Scope: **Starknet apps only** for now. On the roadmap for later versions: EVM wallet support, prediction-market-type (Polymarket-style) app flows, and frontend design guidance for privacy UX.

Statuses baked into this skill are as of mid-July 2026, after the July 8, 2026 open-source launch of the [Privacy SDK monorepo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy) ([quickstart](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-privacy/blob/main/sdk/README.md)); the skill instructs the agent to re-verify fast-moving items (wallet readiness, package versions, repo paths) before finalizing a plan.
